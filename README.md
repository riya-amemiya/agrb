Interactive CLI to safely rebase a branch onto another. Supports two strategies:

- Cherry-pick based replay that skips merge commits
- Linear history via `git rebase`

The UI is built with Ink and lets you select the target branch interactively.

Read this in Japanese: see `README.ja.md`.

## Install

```bash
npm install --global agrb
```

## Usage

```bash
agrb [options]
```

Options:

- `--target, -t <branch>`: Target branch. If omitted, select interactively
- `--allow-empty`: Allow empty commits during cherry-pick
- `--linear`: Use `git rebase` for a linear history (default is cherry-pick)
- `--continue-on-conflict`: In linear mode, continue rebase on conflicts using `ours` strategy
- `--remote-target`: Select target branch from remote tracking branches (`origin/*`)
- `--on-conflict <strategy>`: In cherry-pick mode, specify conflict resolution strategy.
  - Strategies:
    - `pause` (default): pause on conflict, allowing manual resolution.
      After resolving, press Enter to continue.
    - `skip`: automatically skip the conflicting commit.
    - `ours`: automatically resolve conflict using 'ours' strategy.
    - `theirs`: automatically resolve conflict using 'theirs' strategy.

### Examples

```bash
# Rebase onto main (cherry-pick based)
agrb --target main

# Rebase onto develop with linear history
agrb --target develop --linear

# Continue on conflicts using ours strategy
agrb --linear --continue-on-conflict

# Select target from remote branches
agrb --remote-target

# Allow empty commits
agrb --allow-empty
```

## How it works

In the default cherry-pick mode, non-merge commits between `merge-base(<target>, <current>)` and the current branch are applied onto a temporary branch created from `<target>`. Empty commits or conflicts are automatically skipped. You can intentionally include empty commits with `--allow-empty`. On success, the current branch is hard-reset to the temp branch.

In linear mode (`--linear`), `git rebase origin/<target>` is executed. With `--continue-on-conflict`, the command tries `-X ours`, stages changes, and runs `git rebase --continue`.
